<Aside type="caution">
	This application is under extremely active development, and breaking changes may occur frequently.
  You should pin to a specific version (e.g. `dawarich_image_version: "0.34"`) and monitor the [release notes](https://github.com/Freika/dawarich/releases) manually for updates.

  The application is stable, but should not be updated blindly, especially with something like [Watchtower](../watchtower)
</Aside>

Self-hostable alternative to Google Timeline (Google Location History) 

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
dawarich_enabled: true

# For the reasons above, you should pin to a specific version, starting with whatever the latest is at the time of installation.
dawarich_image_version: latest
```

By default, Dawarich can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:9393` or `https://dawarich.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../guides/dns-access) configured.

## Configuration

Dawarich can integrate with [Home Assistant](./homeassistant) to ingest location data from the Home Assistant mobile app.
See instructions for setting this up here: https://dawarich.app/docs/tutorials/track-your-location/#home-assistant

See the default configuration options for Dawarich at [`roles/dawarich/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/dawarich/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
