"Firefly III" is a self-hosted manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. Using a bunch of external tools, you can import data. It also has many neat financial reports available.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
firefly_enabled: true
```

By default, Firefly III can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:8066` or `https://firefly.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Firefly III at [`roles/firefly/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/firefly/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
