iSpy's Agent DVR is standalone free-to-use NVR software for IP Camera management.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
ispyagentdvr_enabled: true
```

By default, iSpy Agent DVR can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:8098`.
Unfortunately, accessing through reverse proxy (DNS) is blocked unless you [purchase a license](https://www.ispyconnect.com/buy). If you have a license, iSpy Agent DVR can be accessed at `https://ispyagentdvr.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

If you have [Home Assistant](../homeassistant/) running, you can install the [Agent DVR integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/agent_dvr/), which you can connect directly through IP, and then access Home Assistant via DNS.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for iSpy Agent DVR at [`roles/ispyagentdvr/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/ispyagentdvr/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
