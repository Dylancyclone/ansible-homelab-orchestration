Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager, meal planner and shopping list with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family. Easily add recipes into your database by providing the URL and Mealie will automatically import the relevant data, or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
mealie_enabled: true
```

By default, Mealie can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:9925` or `https://mealie.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Mealie at [`roles/mealie/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/mealie/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
