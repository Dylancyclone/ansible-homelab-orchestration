Airsonic-Advanced is a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitous access to your music. It is a more modern implementation of the Airsonic fork with several key performance and feature enhancements. It adds and supersedes several features in Airsonic.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
airsonic_enabled: true
```

By default, Airsonic-Advanced can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:9000` or `https://airsonic.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Airsonic-Advanced at [`roles/airsonic/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/airsonic/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
