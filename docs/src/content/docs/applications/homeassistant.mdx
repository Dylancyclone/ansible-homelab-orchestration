Open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
homeassistant_enabled: true
```

You will need to complete first-time setup through the server's IP and Home Assistant's port first: `http://[your_server_ip]:8123`.
Once set up, you can configure the Home Assistant [HTTP Plugin](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/) to enable access via reverse proxies (DNS): https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/http/#reverse-proxies

By default, Home Assistant can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:8123` or `https://homeassistant.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

Home Assistant can publish metrics to [Prometheus](../prometheus/) for monitoring.
To enable this integration, set `prometheus_homeassistant_long_lived_access_token` to a Home Assistant [long lived access token](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
# You'll need to create a long lived access token: https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token
prometheus_homeassistant_long_lived_access_token: abcd
```

Be sure to check out the extensive list of [Home Assistant Integrations](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/) to connect your other devices and services!
Here is a nice link that will show all integrations sorted by number of installs: [https://analytics.home-assistant.io/integrations/](https://analytics.home-assistant.io/integrations/).
Though remember that a lot of power comes from less popular integrations that may be more specific to your use case, such as gleaning power information from an integration with your local power company.

See the default configuration options for Home Assistant at [`roles/homeassistant/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/homeassistant/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
