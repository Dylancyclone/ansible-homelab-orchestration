Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy.

<Aside>
	Unlike most applications in Ansible Homelab Orchestration, Traefik needs a little more configuration to get started.
  Please refer to the [DNS Access Guide](/../../guides/dns-access/) for instructions on how to set up Traefik for DNS access.
