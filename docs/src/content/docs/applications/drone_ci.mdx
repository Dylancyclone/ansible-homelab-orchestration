Drone is a modern CI/CD platform built with a containers-first architecture. It enables you to conveniently set up projects to automatically build, test, and deploy as you make changes to your code. It's open source, highly configurable (every build step is executed by a container!) and has a lot of plugins available. Drone is built using Go and utilizes Docker. It can be run inside a container itself with very little configuration.

## Setting up

Drone-CI is set up to connect to [Gitea](../gitea/) automatically, so make sure you have Gitea set up and configured first.

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
drone_ci_enabled: true

# The users that'll be granted admin, comma separated. Should match a gitea user.
drone_ci_admin_user: admin

# shared secret - use openssl rand -hex 16 to generate your own
drone_ci_agent_secret: d052ab29a86a02c6b6ff1e5851ee15e1

# Gitea auth credentials. see https://drone-ci.org/docs/administration/forges/gitea for more info
drone_ci_gitea_client_id: notset
drone_ci_gitea_client_secret: notset
```

By default, Drone-CI can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:8001` or `https://drone_ci.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Drone-CI at [`roles/drone_ci/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/drone_ci/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
