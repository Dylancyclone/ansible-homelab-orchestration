Foundry VTT is a Virtual Tabletop application for role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). It provides a stage for visualizing the game environment and tools allowing the game master and players to organize and track statistics and notes.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
foundryvtt_enabled: true

# You will need to log into your FoundryVTT for first-time setup
foundryvtt_username: ""
foundryvtt_password: ""

# You will want to change the default admin login
foundryvtt_admin_key: ""
```

By default, Foundry VTT can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:3005` or `https://foundryvtt.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../guides/dns-access) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Foundry VTT at [`roles/foundryvtt/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/foundryvtt/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
