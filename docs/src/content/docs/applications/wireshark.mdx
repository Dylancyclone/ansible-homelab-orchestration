Wireshark is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
wireshark_enabled: true
```

By default, Wireshark can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:3010` or `https://wireshark.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../guides/dns-access) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Wireshark at [`roles/wireshark/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/wireshark/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
