<Tags tags={frontmatter.tags} />

Unofficial Bitwarden compatible server written in Rust and compatible with official Bitwarden clients, perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.

This role also contains a backup solution using [Bruceforce's Vaultwarden Backup](https://gitlab.com/1O/vaultwarden-backup)

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
bitwarden_enabled: true

# You will want to change the default admin token
# This token can be anything, but it's recommended to use a long, randomly generated string of characters,
# for example running openssl rand -base64 48
bitwarden_admin_token: qwertyuiop1234567890poiuytrewq0987654321

# To create a user set this to "true" and run the playbook.
# Once you have created your user, set to "false" and run the playbook again.
# Target just Bitwarden by running: ansible-playbook -i inventory homelab.yml --tags="bitwarden"
bitwarden_allow_signups: false
```

By default, Bitwarden can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:19080` or `https://bitwarden.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Bitwarden at [`roles/bitwarden/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/bitwarden/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
