Paperless-ngx is a document management system that transforms your physical documents into a searchable online archive so you can keep, well, less paper.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
paperless_ngx_enabled: true

# You should change the default admin credentials
# These will not change an existing [super]user's password, nor will it recreate a user that already exists.
paperless_ngx_admin_user: ""
paperless_ngx_admin_password: ""
paperless_ngx_admin_mail: ""

# !!IMPORTANT!!
# when **enabling** traefik set the secret key to a long random string; you don't have to remember it.
# If not set, default value(which is well known) will be used
# user for example https://numbergenerator.org/randomnumbergenerator/ascii
# or
# https://numbergenerator.org/hex-code-generator#!numbers=1&length=128&addfilters=
paperless_ngx_secret_key: "very_long-string!-09skjlOJIOKSN-ofrandonm-charcters!_?"
```

By default, Paperless-ngx can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:16922` or `https://paperless_ngx.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

If you didn't set up an admin user on first boot, you can still create a superuser from the command line:

```bash
docker exec -it paperless_ngx_uiserver python manage.py createsuperuser
```

This will prompt you to set a username, an optional e-mail address and finally a password (at least 8 characters).

See the default configuration options for Paperless-ngx at [`roles/paperless_ngx/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/paperless_ngx/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
