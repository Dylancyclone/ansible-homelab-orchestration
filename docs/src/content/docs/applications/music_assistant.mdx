Music Assistant is a free, opensource Media library manager that connects to your streaming services and a wide range of connected speakers.

Music Assistant can be operated as a complete standalone product but it is actually tailored to use side by side with [Home Assistant](./homeassistant).

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
music_assistant_enabled: true
```

By default, Music Assistant can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:8095` or `https://music_assistant.[your_domain].com` if you have [DNS access](../guides/dns-access) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Music Assistant at [`roles/music_assistant/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/music_assistant/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
