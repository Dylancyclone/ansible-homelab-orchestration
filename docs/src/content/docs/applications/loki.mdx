</Aside>

Loki is a horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system inspired by [Prometheus](../prometheus/). It is designed to be very cost effective and easy to operate. It does not index the contents of the logs, but rather a set of labels for each log stream.

## Setting up

```yaml title="inventories/homelab/group_vars/homelab.yml"
loki_enabled: true
```

By default, Loki can be accessed at `http://[your_server_ip]:3100/metrics` or `https://loki.[your_domain].com/metrics` if you have [DNS access](../../guides/dns-access/) configured.

## Configuration

See the default configuration options for Loki at [`roles/loki/defaults/main.yml`](https://github.com/Dylancyclone/ansible-homelab-orchestration/blob/main/roles/loki/defaults/main.yml).
Add any overrides to your `inventories/[your_inventory]/group_vars/homelab.yml` file.
