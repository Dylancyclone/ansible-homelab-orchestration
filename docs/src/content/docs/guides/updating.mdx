To update Ansible Homelab Orchestration to get the latest applications and fixes, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Pull the latest changes from the GitHub repository:

   ```sh
   git pull
   ```

2. Make any changes in your inventory you would like, for example, enabling a new application
3. Run the playbook:
   ```sh
   ansible-playbook -i inventories/homelab/inventory playbook.yml
   ```

</Steps>

## Handling Breaking Changes

If your playbook fails to run after updating, check the error message for information.
Most likely, there has been a breaking change that needs your attention before a certain application can be deployed again.

Breaking changes can happen for a couple reasons, such as:
- An application has changed its configuration options and manual changes are needed from you
   - For example, an application changed the format of an API key and the user needs to update it before updating the application
   - If a change can be made without the user's input (such as renaming an environment variable), you will not need to do anything
- A mistake was made in a previous version of this playbook that can't be fixed automatically

<Aside type="tip">
	If you would like to temporarily ignore an application with a breaking change,
	add `--skip-tags="[app_name]"` (e.g. `--skip-tags="portainer"`) to your
	ansible-playbook command. This will let you deploy other applications while
	you address the breaking changes.
</Aside>

Look at the breaking change file located at `state/BREAKING_CHANGE_[app_name].txt` and the documentation page for that application to see what changes are required.
Required actions can range from updating your configuration to performing manual steps on your homelab server.
