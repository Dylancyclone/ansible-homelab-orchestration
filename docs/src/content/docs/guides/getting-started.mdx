## Installation

### Requirements

- Ansible installed on your computer (A control node, see the [Ansible docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) for help)
- SSH access to your homelab server that has Docker installed. Currently, the following operating systems have been tested (older versions and other OSs may work, but most testing occurs on Ubuntu):
   - Ubuntu 24.04 LTS+
   - Debian 13+
   - Fedora 42+

<Aside type="tip">
	A second computer is optional, you can orchestrate containers on your local
	machine if you wish.
