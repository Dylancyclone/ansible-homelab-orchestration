Creating a new role for an application is greatly assisted by a Python script that generates a basic role based on user input.

You can run the script with:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_role.py
```

It will then ask you a number of questions about the application you are adding, then generate a role in the `roles/` directory as well as boilerplate documentation in the `docs/src/content/docs/applications/` directory.
Make sure to review and update the generated files to ensure your application is configured correctly.

## Testing Changes

Ansible Homelab Orchestration also comes with a suite of automated tests to ensure clean code and functionality.
For example, the tests ensure:

- All created containers and networks are removed when stopping applications
- All applications have consistent variable names and settings
- All applications properly implement DNS and external access settings
- No port conflicts between applications
- etc

To run the tests, run:

```bash
python tests/test.py
```

Make sure all tests pass before submitting a pull request!
