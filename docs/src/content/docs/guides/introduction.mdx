Ansible Homelab Orchestration is a project that sets up and installs applications on your homelab using Docker.
It is greatly inspired by [Ansible-NAS](https://github.com/davestephens/ansible-nas), but has a number of important differences:

- Does not require root to run
- Runs containers with minimum privileges (no root unless absolutely necessary)
- Allow any application to have it's name, image name and version overridden (in case of version pinning or running forks)
- Does not modify existing system settings/configuration
- Separates DNS access from external access (for example, access `portainer.example.com` on local network without exposing it to the internet)
- Notifies the user of breaking changes in an application's ansible role before updating them
- Everything is optional, doesn't install anything except what's configured by the user
- Cleans up networks and containers more gracefully after disabling applications, and ensure nothing is left dangling
- Supports more OSs than just Ubuntu
- Includes suite of tests to ensure clean code and functionality
   - All created containers and networks are removed when stopping applications
   - Ensures all applications have consistent variable names and settings
   - Ensures all applications properly implement DNS and external access settings
   - Ensures no port conflicts between applications
   - etc
