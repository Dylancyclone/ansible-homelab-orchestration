### application_last_run_hashes.csv

This file keeps track of the latest git commit hash when each application was last run. This is used to detect breaking changes in applications.

For example, if an application was last run at commit hash `abc1234`, and a breaking change was made in the newly-pulled `def5678`, the ansible playbook will detect this and block the deployment until the user has manually reviewed and fixed any breaking changes.

Do not edit this file manually.
